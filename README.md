# rmod
A simple cli tool to recursively search a directory for node_modules and remove them.

A project written to learn Rust.

### USAGE - DEV
---
- Clone the repo locally
- `cd` into the repo
- Run `cargo run YOUR_DIR` where YOUR_DIR is a valid directory you wish to search
- Away we go!

### TODO:
---
- Tests
- Configure for more platforms e.g. Windows
- Better safety on recursive searching e.g. max-depth
- Annotate with lifetimes
- General tidying up
